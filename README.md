# Spree Test Task

Assume that your client wants to upload their products from a .csv file.

We'd like you to prepare a feature that will let users to upload a .csv file with products and variants, process it and create spree products with variants in database. Sample .csv file is provided in the repository main directory.

Weâ€™ll share a source code for an app via [zip file on google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s2QBWjuPAP-uIOAsPKfEnEGhBq6ZYMnN).

( Download it -> Create a repo on Github -> Add required functionality / tests -> Submit for review ) repository with you. Please fork it and create your solution on your fork. Then share it back to us when you're finished.

In Spark Solutions we believe in the power of tests (TDD), so we'd be happy if you create tests for your solution. It would be great too, if your solution could handle huge files without freezing the whole app for hours.

## Objective

Add a feature that will let admins upload products to the Spree database from a .csv file

## Bonus points

* Tests
* processing of huge uploads
** Extendability (so it's easy to add something to your solution)
** Good commit messages / comments

This task shouldn't take more than few hours. We respect your time and responsibilities, so we would expect you to share your solution within 7 days from day when you receive this task.

We don't expect a perfect solution, so just share your solution with us for code review.
